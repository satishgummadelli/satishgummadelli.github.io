# Cloud Computing

 Delivery of on demand computing resources.

- pay for what you use
- Elastic resources
- self and Metered services
- from single machine to data centers in minutes

AWS provides a service-driven application architecture in which you choose a specific service, such as S3, to perform specific tasks, such as to back up files on a hard drive.

## Cloud Computing Advantages

- Global in minutes
- variable expense
- Economies of Scale
- Stop guessing capacity
- Increase Speed and Agility
- Focus on Business differentiators



### Service Driven application
Also known as [SOA] - Service Oriented Architecture [reliable, flexible services]


#### Software Architecture evolution

client-server -> [SOA] -> [MicroServices]

# Cloud Computing Service Models

Cloud Providers provide their services according to different Models, if we stack layers they are like this



Layers of service models | examples
--- |---|
SaaS |CRM, email, games
PaaS | databse, webserver, development tools
IaaS | Virtual Machines, Network, load balancers


## SaaS
A software distribution service that lets you use applications without actually having the applications installed locally. Another term used to describe this service is software on demand. The host, Provider, maintains the software, provides the required licenses, and does all the other work needed to make the software available.
SaaS typically keeps the host completely in control and doesnâ€™t offer any sort of monitoring.

### providers:
Salesforce CRM
Gmail
Many Monitoring providers[New Relic]
Many Database Providers [AWS RDS]

## PaaS
A platform provides a complete solution for running software in an integrated manner on a particular piece of hardware. For example, Windows is a particular kind of platform. The virtual platform provided by PaaS allows a customer to develop, run, and manage applications of all sorts.
PaaS is more of a development solution than a production environment solution

### providers:
RedHat Openshift
Google App Engine
Microsoft Azure


## IaaS
A form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources. You essentially use IaaS to replace physical resources, such as servers, with virtual resources hosted and managed by Amazon.

### providers:
- Amazon AWS
- Windows Azure
- Google Compute Engine
- Rackspace open Cloud



There are other models like,  DaaS, i.e Database as a service , XaaS everything as a service

# Cloud Computing Deployment Models

- All in the Cloud
- Hybrid
- On Premises




Exercises:
1) Continuous Integration tools
 Hari: Jenkins, Bamboo, Teamcity, Travis CI, GO CD.
 Krishna:
2) Agile, Scrum, Kanban, Lean methodologies
Hari:
Agile describes a set of principles for software developement under which requirements and solutions eveolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams. It advocates planning, eveolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change. These principles support the definition and continuing evelution of many software development methods.

Krishna:
3) SOA, Microservices, REST
