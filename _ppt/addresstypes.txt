Class A : 0--- : If the first bit of an IPv4 address is "0",
this means that the address is part of class A. This means that any address from 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 is in class A.

    from:      0.  0.  0.  0 = 00000000.00000000.00000000.00000000
      to:    127.255.255.255 = 01111111.11111111.11111111.11111111
                               0nnnnnnn.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH

Class B : 10-- : Class B includes any address from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255.
This represents the addresses that have a "1" for their first bit, but don't have a "1" for their second bit.

    from:      128.  0.  0.  0 = 10000000.00000000.00000000.00000000
      to:      191.255.255.255 = 10111111.11111111.11111111.11111111
                                 10nnnnnn.nnnnnnnn.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH

Class C
    110- : Class C is defined as the addresses ranging from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255.
 This represents all of the addresses with a "1" for their first two bits, but without a "1" for their third bit.


    from:      192.  0.  0.  0 = 11000000.00000000.00000000.00000000

                                 110nnnnn.nnnnnnnn.nnnnnnnn.HHHHHHHH

Class D
      1110 : This class includes addresses that have "111" as their first three bits, but a "0" for the next bit.
      This address range includes addresses from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.
    from:      224.  0.  0.  0 = 11100000.00000000.00000000.00000000
      to:      239.255.255.255 = 11101111.11111111.11111111.11111111
                                 1110XXXX.XXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX

Class E
  1111 : This class defines addresses between 240.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.255.
    Any address that begins with four "1" bits is included in this class.
    from:      240.  0.  0.  0 = 11110000.00000000.00000000.00000000
      to:      255.255.255.255 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111

Class A addresses, the addresses from 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 are reserved for private network assignment.
For class B, this range is 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255.

For class C, the range of 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 is reserved for private usage.



The process of dividing a network into smaller network sections is called subnetting.

This can be useful for many different purposes and helps isolate groups of hosts together and deal with them easily.
